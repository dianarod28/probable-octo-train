  <h2>Cebu’s Beaches and Diving Spots</h2>
  <p>
    Cebu has been recently awarded as part of UNESCO’s Network of Creative Cities, but its main treasure lies deep down. The island draws over two million foreign travelers every year, greeted by rich waters teeming with abundant marine life.

Diving in Cebu is also a great experience as the island boasts many beautiful Cebu diving spots in the entire country and even the world, featuring underwater caves, shallow shipwrecks, and marine sanctuaries.

  <h2>Cloud 9, Siargao</h2>
  <p>
    Siargao’s rise as a top tourist destination in the Philippines is nothing short of meteoric. Once a sleepy island in Surigao del Norte, it has become one of the favorite destinations and playgrounds for travelers, and it is primarily because of one activity: surfing.

It is now known as the Philippines' surfing capital, and some even regard it as the surfing mecca of Asia.

  <h2>Sudlon National Park</h2>
  <p>
    Sudlon National Park is a protected zone belonging to the Central Cebu Protected Landscape (CCPL) under Republic Act No. 9486 or the “Central Cebu Protected Landscape Act of 2007”. It houses some of Cebu’s endemic and indigenous species and a couple of heritage structures. The name “Sudlon”, which is derived from the Cebuano word for “enter”, comes from the fact that several underground caves in the area act as passages for water.

  <h2>Coron</h2>
  <p>
    In contrast to El Nido’s amazing “over water” views, go to Coron for spectacular underwater views. Here, you can see colorful coral gardens, pristine waters, lots of marine life, and even sunken WWII Japanese shipwrecks. Don’t get me wrong, Coron can hold its own when it comes to scenic views over the water as well. This paradise is home to hidden emerald/blue lagoons surrounded by limestone cliffs. There’s no shortage of incredibly beautiful fine white sand beaches in Coron either.

  <h2>Balabac Islands</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re looking for the best beaches & most vibrant waters in the Philippines, look nowhere else. Balabac is worth a spot at the VERY TOP of your bucketlist.

Balabac is the southernmost group of islands in Palawan. It is so far south that Sabah, in East Malaysia is nearer to Balabac than Puerto Princesa, the provincial capital of Palawan.
The main draw here are 31 gorgeous islands still vastly undiscovered by tourist crowds. These islands are surrounded by pristine, crystal clear waters and white sand beaches.

  <h2>Batanes Islands</h2>
  <p>
    Batanes is the northernmost province of the Philippines. These remote islands are shaped by volcanic forces and strong typhoons. The natural landscape of Batanes is distinct from other parts of the Philippines. Here, you’ll find vibrant green rolling hills, grazing cows, steep seaside cliffs, sparkling clear blue waters, traditional stone houses, and iconic lighthouses.
